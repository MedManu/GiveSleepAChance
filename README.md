# GiveSleepAChance
This is an Application which is a project for my University, and it should help to track and save data from people we are testing.
we track the time they need to run 100 meters and to do a quick concentration Test. 
What it should can do:
•	There is a Login where different users could access the application.
•	On the first View after the Login, should be a list with all the people you have tested and when you click on a person, 
•	another screen should display their name and times they needed for the test.
•	You can also create a new Test person or a new user in different screens.
It should save the data in a database like MySQL. 
I tartest learning swift 2 months ago, so everything is new to me, that’s why this all is new to me.
